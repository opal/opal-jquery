## [0.5.0](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.4.6...HEAD) Unreleased

*   Remove support for Zepto.
    Zepto hasn't received substantial updates for several and is no longer under active development.
    opal-jquery will still accept PRs targeting Zepto as long as they're compatible with jQuery.

## [0.4.6](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.4.5...v0.4.6) Unreleased

* Initialize @@__isReady (#115)

* Added `Element#select` (#111)

## [0.4.5](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.4.4...v0.4.5) 2021-07-28

*   Expose `Element#replace_all` and `Element#replace_with` (#110)

*   Open the opal dependency to any 1.x

## [0.4.4](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.4.3...v0.4.4) 2019-07-01

*   Allow Opal 1.0 in gemspec

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.4.2...v0.4.3) 2018-09-07

*   Add `Element#==` as an alias of `.is()`

*   Add `Element#method_missing` to allow not yet wrapped methods and plugins to be accessed with zero setup

*   Avoid `||` in JS-land because it would consider some values as falsy (e.g. `""` and `0`). **breaking**

*   Call `Element#prop` via `Native.call` to get the right semantics around `nil` vs. `undefined` **breaking**

*   Expose `Element#click`

*   Fix semantics of `Element#attr` to better reflect jQuery's **breaking**

*   Skip sending a callback to `Element#animate` if no block is given

*   Let `Element#data` return a usable Ruby object (`Array`/`Hash`) instead of a native one **breaking**

*   Don't wrap events with `Event.new` if no args are provided or the event is not a native object to increase performance in `Element#on` and `Element#one`

*   Rename the internal property holding the callback wrapper in `Element#on` and `Element#one` from `._jq_wrap` to `.$$jqwrap` to avoid polluting instance variables and following the custom of Opal's core classes

*   Fix `Element#value`, `Element#height` and `Element#width` to perform the `||` at ruby level to avoid overwriting values that are *falsy* in JavaScript with `nil` **breaking**

*   Add `Element#==` as an alias to jQuery's `.is()`

*   Add `Element#method_missing` and `Element#respond_to_missing?` to forward calls to native plugins

*   Add `HTTP#inspect` with a basic summary

*   Updated specs to also use jQuery 3

*   Allow Opal v0.11.0

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2) 2016-07-04

*   Allow Opal v0.10.0

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) 2015-11-02

*   Updated specs to use jQuery 1.8 (that was initially released in 2012)

*   `Element.parse` now relies on `$.parseHTML` in conjunction with `$` enforcing actual HTML parsing.

*   Added `Document.ready` that returns a promise for `Document.ready?`

*   `Document.ready?` now works even after the document is loaded (unlike jQuery)

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/opal/opal-jquery/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) 2015-07-17

*   `Element#[]=` now removes the attribute when the assigned value is nil.

*   `Element#attr` now better follows jQuery's behaviour by checking the number of arguments passed. Also it's now just a proxy to `Element#[]` and `Element#[]=`

*   `Element#[]` now returns `nil` only for attributes that are missing, better following jQuery behaviour (which is to return `undefined` on such attributes). `Element#has_attribute?` has been updated accordingly.

*   Add `Element#prepend` method.

## 0.3.0 2015-02-03

*   Move all files under `opal/jquery` require namespace, rather than
    current `opal-jquery` require paths.

*   Add `Browser::Window` class, and make `::Window` an instance of it.

*   Make `Document` include `Browser::DocumentMethods` which is a simple
    module to define custom methods for `Document`.

*   Cleanup HTTP implementation.

*   `Element#[]` and `Element#attr` now return `nil` for empty attributes,
    instead of returning an empty string.

*   Add `HTTP.setup` and `HTTP.setup=` to access `$.ajaxSetup`

*   Add PATCH and HEAD support to `HTTP`

*   Let `Element` accept previously defined `JQUERY_CLASS` and `JQUERY_SELECTOR`
    for environments such as node-webkit where `$` can't be found in the global object.

*   Add Promise support to `HTTP` get/post/put/delete methods. Also remove
    `HTTP#callback` and `#errback` methods.

## 0.2.0 2014-03-12

*   Add `Document.body` and `Document.head` shortcut to element instances.

*   Add `Event` methods: `prevented?`, `prevent`, `stopped?` and `stop` to
    replace longer javascript names.

*   Add `LocalStorage` implementation.

*   Fix `Element#data()` to return `nil` for an undefined data attribute
    instead of null.

*   Expose `#detach` method on `Element`.

## 0.1.2 2013-12-01

*   Support setting html content through `Element#html()`.

    wrapped `document`.

## 0.0.8 2013-05-02

*   Depreceate Document in favor of $document global.

*   Add HTTP.delete() for creating DELETE request.

## 0.0.7 2013-02-20

*   Add Element#method\_missing which forwards missing calls to try and call
    method as a native jquery function/plugin.

*   Depreceate Document finder methods (Document.find, Document[]). The finder
    methods on Element now replace them. Updated specs to suit.
