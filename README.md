# opal-jquery: jQuery Wrapper For Opal

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/opal/opal-jquery/master.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/opal/opal-jquery)

opal-jquery provides DOM access to opal by wrapping jQuery (or zepto)
and providing a nice ruby syntax for dealing with jQuery instances.

See the Opal website for [documentation](http://opalrb.org/docs/jquery).

## Installation

Install opal-jquery from RubyGems:

```
$ gem install opal-jquery
```

Or include it in your Gemfile for Bundler:

```ruby
gem 'opal-jquery'
```
## Running Specs

Get the dependencies:

    $ bundle install

### Browser

You can run the specs in any web browser, by running the `config.ru` rack file:

    $ bundle exec rackup

And then visiting `http://localhost:9292` in any web browser.

### Phantomjs

You will need phantomjs to run the specs outside the browser.  It can
be downloaded at [http://phantomjs.org/download.html](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)

On osx you can install through homebrew

    $ brew update; brew install phantomjs

Run the tests inside a phantom.js runner:

    $ bundle exec rake

### Zepto

opal-jquery also supports zepto. To run specs for zepto use the rake task:

    $ bundle exec rake zepto

## Getting Started

### Usage

`opal-jquery` can now be easily added to your opal application sources using a
standard require:

```ruby
# app/application.rb
require 'opal'
require 'jquery'
require 'opal-jquery'

alert "Hello from jquery + opal"
```

> **Note**: this file requires two important dependencies, `jquery` and `opal-jquery`.
> You need to bring your own `jquery.js` file as the gem does not include one. If
> you are using the asset pipeline with rails, then this should be available
> already, otherwise download a copy and place it into `app/` or whichever directory
> you are compiling assets from. You can alternatively require a zepto instance.

The `#alert` method is provided by `opal-jquery`. If the message displays, then
`jquery` support should be working.

### How does opal-jquery work

`opal-jquery` provides an `Element` class, whose instances are toll-free
bridged instances of jquery objects. Just like ruby arrays are just javascript
arrays, `Element` instances are just jquery objects. This makes interaction
with jquery plugins much easier.

Also, `Element` will try to bridge with Zepto if it cannot find jQuery loaded,
making it ideal for mobile applications as well.

## Interacting with the DOM

### Finding Elements

opal-jquery provides the `Element` class, which can be used to find elements in
the current document:

```ruby
Element.find('#header')
```

`Element.find` is aliased to `Element[]`:

```ruby
Element['.my-class']
```

These methods acts just like `$('selector')`, and can use any jQuery
compatible selector:

```ruby
Element.find('#navigation li:last')
```

The result is just a jQuery instance, which is toll-free bridged to
instances of the `Element` class in ruby:

```ruby
Element.find('.foo').class
# => Element
```

Instances of `Element` also have the `#find` method available for
finding elements within the scope of each DOM node represented by
the instance:

```ruby
el = Element.find('#header')
el.find '.foo'
# => #<Element .... >
```

### Running code on document ready

Just like jQuery, opal-jquery requires the document to be ready to
be able to fully interact with the page. Any top level access should
use the `ready?` method:

```ruby
Document.ready? do
  alert "document is ready to go!"
end
```

or the equivilent `Document.ready` promise which is useful when combined with other promises:

```ruby
Document.ready.then do |ready|
  alert "Page is ready to use!"
end
```

Notice the use of the `Kernel#alert` method.

### Event handling

The `Element#on` method is used to attach event handlers to elements:

```ruby
Element.find('#header').on :click do
  puts "The header was clicked!"
end
```

Selectors can also be passed as a second argument to handle events
on certain children:

```ruby
Element.find('#header').on(:click, '.foo') do
  puts "An element with a 'foo' class was clicked"
end
```

An `Event` instance is optionally passed to block handlers as well,
which is toll-free bridged to jquery events:

```ruby
Element.find('#my_link').on(:click) do |evt|
  evt.stop_propagation
  puts "stopped the event!"
end
```

You can access the element which triggered the event by `#current_target`.

```ruby
Document.on :click do |evt|
  puts "clicked on: #{evt.current_target}"
end
```

### CSS styles and classnames

The various jQuery methods are available on `Element` instances:

```ruby
foo = Element.find('.foo')

foo.add_class 'blue'
foo.remove_class 'foo'
foo.toggle_class 'selected'
```

There are also added convenience methods for opal-jquery:

```ruby
foo = Element.find('#header')

foo.class_name
# => 'red lorry'

foo.class_name = 'yellow house'

foo.class_name
# => 'yellow house'
```

`Element#css` also exists for getting/setting css styles:

```ruby
el = Element.find('#container')
el.css 'color', 'blue'
el.css 'color'
# => 'blue'
```

## HTTP/AJAX requests

jQuery's Ajax implementation is also wrapped in the top level HTTP
class.

```ruby
HTTP.get("/users/1.json") do |response|
  puts response.body
  # => "{\"name\": \"Adam Beynon\"}"
end
```

The block passed to this method is used as the handler when the request
succeeds, as well as when it fails. To determine whether the request
was successful, use the `ok?` method:

```ruby
HTTP.get("/users/2.json") do |response|
  if response.ok?
    alert "successful!"
  else
    alert "request failed :("
  end
end
```

It is also possible to use a different handler for each case:

```ruby
request = HTTP.get("/users/3.json")

request.callback {
  puts "Request worked!"
}

request.errback {
  puts "Request didn't work :("
}
```

The request is actually triggered inside the `HTTP.get` method, but due
to the async nature of the request, the callback and errback handlers can
be added anytime before the request returns.

### Handling responses

Web apps deal with JSON responses quite frequently, so there is a useful
`#json` helper method to get the JSON content from a request:

```ruby
HTTP.get("/users.json") do |response|
  puts response.body
  puts response.json
end

# => "[{\"name\": \"Adam\"},{\"name\": \"Ben\"}]"
# => [{"name" => "Adam"}, {"name" => "Ben"}]
```

The `#body` method will always return the raw response string.

If an error is encountered, then the `#status_code` method will hold the
specific error code from the underlying request:

```ruby
request = HTTP.get("/users/3.json")

request.callback { puts "it worked!" }

request.errback { |response|
  puts "failed with status #{response.status_code}"
}
```

### Supplying an XHR method

To supply an XHR callback include a lambda with the `xhr` option:

```ruby
update_progress = lambda do
  xhr = `new window.XMLHttpRequest()`
  update_progress = lambda do |evt|
    # update your progress here
  end
  `xhr.upload.addEventListener("progress", update_progress, false)`
  xhr
end

cloud_xfer = HTTP.put "http://my.cloud.storage/location", xhr: update_progress, ... etc ...
```
