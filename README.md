# opal-jquery

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opal/opal-jquery.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/opal/opal-jquery)

opal-jquery provides DOM access to opal by wrapping jquery (or zepto)
and providing a nice ruby syntax for dealing with jquery instances.
opal-jquery is [hosted on github](http://github.com/opal/opal-jquery).

jQuery instances are toll-free bridged to instances of the ruby class
`JQuery`, so they can be used interchangeably. The `Document` module also
exists, which provides the simple top level css selector method:

```ruby
elements = Document['.foo']
# => [<div class="foo">, ...]

elements.class
# => JQuery

elements.on(:click) do
  alert "element was clicked"
end
```

### Getting Started

#### Installation

Install opal-jquery from RubyGems:

```
$ gem install opal-jquery
```

Or include it in your Gemfile for Bundler:

```ruby
gem 'opal-jquery'
```

### Interacting with the DOM

#### Finiding elements

opal-jquery provides the `Document` module, which is the best way to
find elements by css selector:

```ruby
Document['#header']
```

This method acts just like `$('selector')`, and can use any jquery
compatible selector:

```ruby
Document['#navigation li:last']
```

The result is just a jquery instance, which is toll-free bridged to
instances of the `Element` class in ruby:

```ruby
Document['.foo'].class
# => Element
```

Instances of `Element` also have the `#find` method available for
finding elements within the scope of each dom node represented by
the instance:

```ruby
el = Document['#header']
el.find '.foo'
# => #<Element .... >
```

#### Running code on document ready

Just like jquery, opal-jquery requires the document to be ready to
be able to fully interact with the page. Any top level access should
use the `ready?` method:

```ruby
Document.ready? do
  alert "document is ready to go!"
end
```

The `Kernel#alert` method is shown above too.

#### Event handling

The `Element#on` method is used to attach event handlers to elements:

```ruby
Document['#header'].on :click do
  puts "The header was clicked!"
end
```

Selectors can also be passed as a second argument to handle events
on certain children:

```ruby
Document['#header'].on(:click, '.foo') do
  puts "An element with a 'foo' class was clicked"
end
```

An `Event` instance is optionally passed to block handlers as well,
which is toll-free bridged to jquery events:

```ruby
Document['#my_link'].on(:click) do |evt|
  evt.stop_propagation
  puts "stopped the event!"
end
```

#### CSS styles and classnames

The various jquery methods are available on `Element` instances:

```ruby
foo = Document['.foo']

foo.add_class 'blue'
foo.remove_class 'foo'
foo.toggle_class 'selected'
```

There are also added convenience methods for opal-jquery:

```ruby
foo = Document['#header']

foo.class_name
# => 'red lorry'

foo.class_name = 'yellow house'

foo.class_name
# => 'yellow house'
```

`Element#css` also exists for getting/setting css styles:

```ruby
el = Document['#container']
el.css 'color', 'blue'
el.css 'color'
# => 'blue'
```

### HTTP/AJAX requests

jQuery's Ajax implementation is also wrapped in the top level HTTP
class.

```ruby
HTTP.get("/users/1.json") do |response|
  puts response.body
  # => "{\"name\": \"Adam Beynon\"}"
end
```

The block passed to this method is used as the handler when the request
succeeds, as well as when it fails. To determine whether the request
was successful, use the `ok?` method:

```ruby
HTTP.get("/users/2.json") do |response|
  if response.ok?
    alert "successful!"
  else
    alert "request failed :("
  end
end
```

It is also possible to use a different handler for each case:

```ruby
request = HTTP.get("/users/3.json")

request.callback {
  puts "Request worked!"
}

request.errback {
  puts "Request didn't work :("
}
```

The request is actually triggered inside the `HTTP.get` method, but due
to the async nature of the request, the callback and errback handlers can
be added anytime before the request returns.

#### Handling responses

Web apps deal with json responses quite frequently, so there is a useful
`#json` helper method to get the json content from a request:

```ruby
HTTP.get("/users.json") do |response|
  puts response.body
  puts response.json
end

# => "[{\"name\": \"Adam\"},{\"name\": \"Ben\"}]"
# => [{"name" => "Adam"}, {"name" => "Ben"}]
```

The `#body` method will always return the raw response string.

If an error is encountered, then the `#status_code` method will hold the
specific error code from the underlying request:

```ruby
request = HTTP.get("/users/3.json")

request.callback { puts "it worked!" }

request.errback { |response|
  puts "failed with status #{response.status_code}"
}
```

### Running Specs

Get the dependencies:

    $ bundle install
    
You will need phantomjs to run the specs outside the browser.  It can
be downloaded at [http://phantomjs.org/download.html](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)

On osx you can install through homebrew

    $ brew update; brew install phantomjs

Build dependencies, opal-jquery and it's specs into `build/`:

    $ rake opal

Run the tests inside a phantom.js runner:

    $ rake
    
You can also run the tests in the browser by opening spec/index.html.

### Development Tips

The following rake task are pertinent to adding/changing
functionality.

* opal - builds the following js files:
  * opal-jquery  - opal jquery
  * opal.js      - the opal runtime
  * opal-spec.js - opal spec framework
  * specs.js     - the spec
* opal:test - runs the specs.  It is the default rake task

If you TDD, you may want to run

    $ rake opal opal:test
    
Or use a guard script that does similar
